# Crossbow Training

## Overview

 This project was my capstone for the game development bootcamp I recently completed, and my first time using Unreal Egnine. I challenged myself to complete the game in in 3-days, which was ridiculous... But was a lot of fun. Crossbow Training is a simple FPS highscore game. You have a crossbow with unlimited ammo and have to walk around a small village map and shoot all 50 targets before the time runs out. There are 2 types of targets: ones that give you points (Normal) , and ones that lose you points (Bomb). Normal targets give 150pts. for a center shot and 50 for anywhere else. Bomb targets, indicated by a slightly red hue and bomb decal in the center, blow apart and subtract 25pts. How high of a score can you get?

 The are a lot of features I wanted to add but wasn't able to within the timeframe, including the main menu being fully functional. 

 ### Features to add:
    -> "Wisps" to guide the player to the nearest 5 un-shot targets
    -> Proper Main Menu "Options" section
    -> Escape menu during gameplay
    -> Moving targets
    -> Countdown audio que when the timer hits 30, 15, 10-0 seconds left
    -> Begining cutscene explaining the game's controls and goal
    -> Player sprint capabilities
    -> Night-mode

## Features

- **3D Design**: A fun midevil themed village in a valley
- **FPS Gameplay**: FPS style crossbow shooting with custom models and animations
- **Low-Poly Vibrant Art style**

## Game Engine

 This game was developed using Unreal Engine 5.3.2

## Game Development

  Development took place over about 3 days. I started with a similar outline style to "Droppin' Tilted" and begain working on mechanics for the game. I opted to use Blueprints instead of C++ for scripting due to the time constraints. Once the mechanics were finalized I begain blocking out the level, for texturess and models I used various packs from the Unreal Asset Store. I wasn't able to find a goot crossbow model with animations, so with this project I also dabbled a bit into Blender for the first time. I took a simeple crossbow model and made a reload animation and bolt model so there was a visible projectile being shot. 

## Challenges and Learnings

 Saying this project was provided a lot of learning opportinities would be an understatment. I didn't realize just how different Unreal and Unity were at first, then I added Blender... I would not recommend this to anyone, but it forced me to grow as a developer in quite a few ways. I had to be extremely organized and have a clear plan of action to meet the deadline. 

## How to Play
