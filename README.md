# Unreal-Projects
 This repo contains both C++ standalone and Unreal Engine game projects.
 
## Project Intentions:
  This website is intended as a convenient way for potential employers or coworkers to learn more about me, my experiences in tech, and my portfolio.

## How can I playtest these games?
  Excellent question! 
   -> Just open the "Builds" folder and downlolad the most recent version (i.e. "v_1.2" vs "v_1.1.8"). 
   -> Extract to your desktop (or wherever you want to store it).
   -> Launch the "(INSERTPROJECTNAMEHERE).exe" and you're set!

## Potential new features (Crossbow Training):
   -> Proper reload animation
   -> Physics on exploding targets
