# Project Outlines

## Crossbow Training
Crossbow Training is a simple FPS highscore game. You have a crossbow with unlimited ammo and have to walk around a small village map and shoot all 50 targets before the time runs out. There are 2 types of targets: ones that give you points (Normal) , and ones that lose you points (Bomb). Normal targets give 150pts. for a center shot and 50 for anywhere else. Bomb targets, indicated by a slightly red hue and bomb decal in the center, blow apart and subtract 25pts. How high of a score can you get?

### Features to add:
    -> "Wisps" to guide the player to the nearest 5 un-shot targets
    -> Proper Main Menu "Options" section
    -> Escape menu during gameplay
